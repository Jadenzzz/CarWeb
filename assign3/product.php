							<h4>Some features of the cars:</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>A bit of a soft touch in the BMW line-up is the BMW 520i. The 520i is one of those cars that has everything you need, in just the right amounts. If there was one car that could be described as being the complete medium-size car, the BMW 520i could take the top honours.</li>
									<li>Room inside the BMW 520i is good. If your size is above average, then the 520i knows how to manage your dimensions with apt talent. Reasonable leg room, and good shoulder and head room allow for this to happen. Open the boot lid, and there is a competitive swag of room to swallow suitcases, sports gear and plenty of large shopping items.</li>
									<li>Always an atmosphere of luxury, the cabin in the BMW 520i is nicely finished. The glass has heat and sun protection glazing, so the hot sunshine need not bother you at all in the 520iâ€™s serene, modern environment. A quiet ride provides a relaxed feel to the way the BMW 520i goes about its business, and it is easy to hold a conversation between front and rear occupants. If the conversation fades away, then the premium six-speaker audio system can take over and play your favourite music pieces.</li>

							<h4>Some features of the cars:</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>VinFast Lux SA2.0 is a model developed on the basis of a luxury SUV from Germany, BMW X5, but has been "Vietnameseized" in many details. VinFast Lux SA2.0 2021 is not so beautiful that people have to "wow wow", but every time this car appears, it attracts a lot of eyes and stands out from the crowd.</li>
									<li>The VinFast SUV model has a length x Width x Height, respectively 4,940 x 1,960 x 1,773 (mm), a wheelbase of 2,933 mm and a ground clearance of 192 mm.</li>
									<li>It is not difficult to recognize many similarities in the interior space of VinFast Lux SA2.0 with the previous BMW X5 prototype. The details of the car's cockpit are influenced by the German brand, but in terms of perfection and meticulousness, perhaps VinFast will need to do more than what Lux SA2.0 currently owns.</li>
									<li>Other facilities on VinFast Lux SA2.0 are currently enough to make users happy, including: button start system, electronic handbrake, USB charger, 13 speakers with amplifier & navigation function, furniture (integrated in the central screen), automatic 2-zone automatic air conditioning, automatic door glass, wireless charging, wifi connection, interior lighting system, automatic anti-glare internal rearview mirror ...</li>
